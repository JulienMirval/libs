- Parsing env variables should be extracted from run()


- Es6 code should be shipped so that unused import can be removed by webpack

Konnector would run the src/ version in dev and would switch to es6/ version on build
es6 conversion is easily done via a codemod

- getAccount should be called fetchAccount
